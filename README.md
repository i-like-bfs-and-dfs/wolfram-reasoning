# Incentivizing Wolfram-based thinking in VLMs via reinforcement learning
I'm experimenting with a GRPO-based RL algorithm to incentivize Wolfram-based representation and reasoning of visual math concepts by the Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct model. The PoC has been implemented with 4x Nvidia H200 GPUs, with potential to improve accuracy via horizontal scaling.

**Figure**: For each prompt, G = 10 output sequences from the model are explored, with advantages calculated amongst these outputs based on the reward model. LoRA (injected into each attention layer in the base model) is used for GRPO updates.

## Dataset
A subset of [🤗 ViRL39K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TIGER-Lab/ViRL39K) introduced in [VL-Rethinker](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/loc/san-diego/poster/119918) paper (see results).

## Latest results (WIP)

**Table**: Evaluation results with in-context learning and GRPO-based exploration and fine-tuning. Code column denotes fraction of outputs with Wolfram code. No Error column denotes fraction of
outputs with error-free Wolfram code. Accuracy column denotes fraction of correct answers after deduction from Wolfram Engine. The prompt and
output token lengths are averaged category-wise, with mean and std. dev. mentioned. 

Although fraction of error-free code is high, further optimization is essential (increasing G, batch size, number of epochs, etc.) to increase accuracy.
